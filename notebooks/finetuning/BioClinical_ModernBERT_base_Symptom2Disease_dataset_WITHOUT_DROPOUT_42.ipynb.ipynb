The cough has gotten violent and comes in fits that are so bad they cause me to pass out. There is a profuse, clear discharge from my nose. My eyes are completely swollen shut, and I have an extreme sensitivity to light. On day two, Koplik spots were visible on my inner cheeks. The rash started at my hairline on day three, moved down to my face and neck by day four, and then to my chest and abdomen by day five. Now, my entire body is blanketed in confluent purple lesions that show widespread tissue death. I am in a coma and require intensive care.\n",
