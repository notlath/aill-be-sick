    "**Steps**\n",
    "1. Load filtered English dataset from Hugging Face.\n",
    "2. Keep only `text` (symptom description) + `label` (disease).\n",
    "3. Build `label2id` / `id2label` mappings; convert labels to integer `labels` field.\n",

      "Row text: This is the sixth day of a severe infection, and my fever is 105.2°F, which no medication has helped. The cough has gotten violent and comes in fits that are so bad they cause me to pass out. There is a profuse, clear discharge from my nose. My eyes are completely swollen shut, and I have an extreme sensitivity to light. On day two, Koplik spots were visible on my inner cheeks. The rash started at my hairline on day three, moved down to my face and neck by day four, and then to my chest and abdomen by day five. Now, my entire body is blanketed in confluent purple lesions that show widespread tissue death. I am in a coma and require intensive care.\n",

A rash began behind my ears on the morning of day three, enveloped my entire head and neck by that evening, and has now spread to my pelvis with purple lesions that have flowed together.
