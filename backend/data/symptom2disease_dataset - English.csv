Dengue,"This 104.6°F fever has been going on for five days, bringing with it a constant deep pain behind my eyes that makes me wear sunglasses indoors. When I stand, my hip joints feel frozen in place. My gums bled yesterday, forcing me to rinse my mouth three times. Although I have hunger pangs, the nausea is so bad it's impossible to eat, and I've also developed red speckles across my chest and back."
Dengue,"This 104.3°F fever has been going on for four days. My headache is unbearable, and the pain in my joints is so incredible that it's really difficult for me to move. I've also seen small red spots appear on my chest and had a nosebleed."

Dengue,"This began on Sunday night with chills, which were soon followed by a 104.4°F fever. Now, on the third day, I'm experiencing a stabbing pain behind my left eye whenever I look sideways, and my hip joints feel frozen when I try to stand up. The weariness is so profound that coffee has no effect, and today, non-itchy red specks have appeared on my elbows."

Dengue,"This fever of mine has been 104.5°F for two days, and the pain behind my eyes is so unbearable that it's impossible to read.

My joints are incredibly inflamed and painful, making the slightest movement agonizing. I've also had several spontaneous nosebleeds today."
Dengue,"This is the fourth day I've had a 104.1°F fever, and the pain behind my eyes has gotten so bad I have to keep the curtains closed. Both of my knees ache whenever I go up stairs. I also realized my gums were bleeding on their own when I woke up this morning from last night's sleep. Then, I found a faint, lacy-looking rash that had spread across my back overnight."
Dengue,"This is the fourth day I've had this unrelenting 104.0°F fever. The pain behind my eyes is so intense that I can't even stand a dimly lit room. My body aches all over as if I've been badly bruised, and my joints are incredibly stiff, especially in my wrists. What's really alarming is the widespread rash of tiny red spots that I first saw across my stomach and arms yesterday."
Dengue,"This is the fourth day of a 104.2°F fever, and there's an unbearable pressure behind my eyeballs that makes even candlelight painful. It feels like my finger joints are completely shattered whenever I grip anything. I had a nosebleed yesterday that lasted for thirty minutes and required an ambulance to transport me. Today, my skin is covered in dark red petechiae that don't fade when I press on them, and they are spreading from my neck down to my ankles."
Dengue,"This is the sixth day of this, and my temperature shot up to 104.2°F this morning. The pain behind my eyes is excruciating; I just want to keep them closed all the time.

Dengue,"This is the third day of being sick; after having a normal temperature the day before, my fever jumped to 104.0°F yesterday and is now at 103.8°F. My eye sockets begin to throb whenever I try to read, and I'm having severe cramps in my lower back muscles. I also saw that my gums were bleeding this morning when I was eating toast."
Dengue,"This marks the fifth day of this nightmare. My fever is 104.3°F and the pain behind my eyes is so severe that I've had to tape my eyelids shut. Every joint, especially my elbows, feels shattered. The nosebleed I had this morning was so heavy it required two towels to contain it. I have pinprick red lesions covering my abdomen, and they are spreading down my legs by the hour."
Dengue,"This morning, I woke up to a 104.6°F fever and a headache that is throbbing relentlessly. The pain behind my eyes is severe, and my muscles are incredibly painful, especially in my arms and shoulders. On top of that, I feel profoundly exhausted."
Dengue,"This relentless fever has been going for four days now, holding steady around 104.9°F. I have a constant, pounding headache, and what's really concerning is the discomfort behind my eyes every time I blink. On top of that, my muscles are aching all over and I've completely lost my appetite, though thankfully, I haven't felt any nausea."
Dengue,"This started five days ago with a 104.9°F fever. My head is throbbing, the pain behind my eyes is severe, and my joints are very stiff and painful, which makes it difficult to move. I'm also seeing small red spots on my arms and legs."
Dengue,"This week, my temperature has been on a wild ride; it was 104.5°F on Sunday, almost normal on Monday, and then it shot up to 103.6°F today. The most difficult thing is how my hip joints lock up completely whenever I try to stand up from a chair. I've also been seeing blood on my toothbrush every morning since Tuesday, and the fatigue today is so bad that even lifting my arm feels like a huge effort."
Dengue,"This whole thing came on suddenly three days ago with a fever of 104.4°F. My temperature has been up and down, but the one thing that's gotten consistently worse is the constant pressure behind my eyes. My joints, particularly in my hips and shoulders, hurt every time I try to move, and I'm feeling more and more wiped out even though I haven't been doing much."
Dengue,"Three days ago, a scorching 105°F fever appeared out of nowhere, bringing a pounding headache along with it. My joints are exceptionally sore, particularly in my wrists and ankles.

My muscles are aching all over, with my shoulders and back feeling the worst, and my appetite has completely disappeared."
Dengue,"Three days ago, I developed a high-grade fever reaching 105°F accompanied by a severe frontal headache. I am experiencing intense body aches and stiffness known as 'breakbone' pain. Instead of respiratory symptoms, a flushed rash has developed over my body. I have no appetite and feel significant pain behind my eyes."

Today, I'm so worn out that I don't have the energy to leave my bed."
Dengue,"Throughout this four-day illness, my temperature has been going up and down, ranging from 104.5°F to 103.9°F. What's really concerning is a deep, aching pain that has developed behind my eyes. All my muscles feel sore to the touch, and I just found some tiny, red dots on my stomach that don't itch."
Dengue,"Today is the fifth day I've had a 104.1°F fever, and the pain behind my eyes is so bad I had to cover my windows with paper to block the light. Any movement at all causes shooting pains in my elbows. Yesterday, I threw up some fluid that had blood in it. Now, about seventy percent of my skin is covered in widespread tiny dots."
Dengue,"Today is the sixth day of being severely ill, and my fever has climbed to 104.7°F. The pain behind my eyes is so bad that I spend most of my time with them shut. All of my joints are in excruciating pain, especially my knees and elbows. I'm also noticing widespread tiny red spots all over my body and my gums have been bleeding sometimes."
Dengue,"Two days ago, I developed a fever of 104.2°F, along with a mild headache and some stiffness in my elbows. I feel a bit worn out, have mild fatigue, and my appetite isn't what it usually is. While the discomfort isn't severe, I just don't feel right."

Dengue,"What began as a 104.6°F fever on Monday has now become a 104.7°F temperature today, bringing with it skull-splitting headaches. Bending my elbows creates a sensation like ground glass is inside them, and I have a strange, deep ache behind my eyes that gets worse when I'm watching TV. I also noticed that small crimson dots showed up on my neck overnight, but I haven't had any issues with bleeding so far."
Dengue,"What began as a mild fever of 104.4°F on Tuesday became a 104.8°F temperature by Wednesday, accompanied by throbbing headaches.

I found red speckles scattered on my thighs this morning; they don't itch, but they look worrisome."
Dengue,"What I thought was just the flu started three days ago with a 104.3°F fever. Yesterday, however, I began feeling an excruciating pain deep behind my eyes every time I turn my head.

Bright red speckles have also just popped up on my forearms."

Dengue,"With this 104.9°F fever, now on its second day, the retro-orbital pain is so severe it feels hazardous to drive. My ankle joints are aching when I walk, and I vomited once after dinner last night. I discovered scattered red dots on my shins and forearms this morning that I hadn't seen yesterday."
Dengue,"Yesterday afternoon, I was suddenly struck by a high-grade fever of 104°F, accompanied by severe, generalized pain in my muscles and joints.

I also noticed a rash appearing on my skin, and I have been fighting off waves of intense nausea."
Dengue,"Yesterday my fever was mild at 104.1°F, but it has shot up to 104.0°F today, and I have a hammering pain in my head. It feels like sandpaper is grinding behind my eyes whenever I move them.

Dengue,"Yesterday was the third day of my fever, which was at 104.9°F. The pain around my eye sockets gets unbearable if I try to watch television.

The fatigue is so overwhelming I can hardly keep my eyes open."

I haven't seen any rash so far."
Dengue,"Yesterday, which was the fourth day of my illness, my temperature reached 104.3°F. The pain I have behind my eyes is so bad that even a dimly lit room is too much to handle.

Dengue,"Yesterday afternoon, I abruptly went from feeling perfectly normal to having a 104.1°F fever.

I have no energy at all, and I can confirm that my gums and nose have not been bleeding."
Dengue,"An awful pain in my muscles, mostly in my legs and back, has been bothering me for the last two days. It all began with a 104.5°F fever and a headache that feels dull.

I'm so exhausted that getting out of bed is a major effort, though I haven't had any pain behind my eyes."

It's a relief that I haven't seen any red spots or a skin rash."

Along with a sore throat and a cough, I have a headache concentrated in the front of my head. My energy is completely gone. I can say for sure that there is no pain located behind my eyes."
Dengue,"Within the last 24 hours, this came on very quickly. I'm experiencing chills, a moderate fever, and my muscles are exceptionally sore. A headache and a persistent dry cough are also part of what I'm feeling. The most difficult symptom is the profound tiredness that rest doesn't seem to help. I've checked, and my gums are not bleeding."
Dengue,"A fever has been present for the past four days, along with a cough that produces thick, yellow-colored phlegm. A sharp pain shoots through my chest whenever I try to take a deep breath. Even when I am resting, I'm having a hard time breathing. I have not experienced anything like a nosebleed."
Dengue,"What started as a simple cough a few days ago has now become much more severe, and I'm bringing up greenish phlegm. My temperature is reading 104.2°F.

Dengue,"After feeling sick for a couple of days with a fever, a cough, and a constantly running nose, I'm now on day three. My eyes were also quite red during that time.

Dengue,"I've been running a fever that tends to get worse in the evenings for the past 10 days. I'm suffering from a bad stomach ache and have also been constipated. I have no desire to eat and feel utterly exhausted. That persistent headache is my main issue, not any pain behind my eyes."

It is just a terrifying feeling of total systemic weakness that I can't shake."
Influenza,"I am extremely worried about my heart because my pulse is racing and I have a fever of 38.5. It struck me all of a sudden while I was cooking dinner and now every muscle in my body is screaming in agony. With my high blood pressure, is this kind of sudden fever going to cause a stroke?

I have never been this scared for my health before in my life."
Influenza,"I am incredibly anxious because my blood sugar is fluctuating and this sudden illness has left me completely drained. My fever is 38.6, and the heat radiating from my body is unbearable.

Is this temperature dangerous for someone my age?"
Influenza,"I am incredibly worried about how heavy my chest feels even though it's mostly a dry cough, but the real misery is this deep bone pain that started three days ago like a switch was flipped.

Is there anything I can take to stop this shivering?"
Influenza,"I am really panicking because I have a fever of 102 that just won't break and the suddenness of it all has me shaken, I was at work on Monday and by the evening I was delirious.

Is it normal to feel this horrible this quickly? I am really panicking about my health right now."

Please, is there anything I can take that won't interact with my blood pressure meds?"
Influenza,"I can't afford to be sick right now which is making me stress out so much, but I physically cannot get out of bed because my legs feel like lead. It started three days ago with a sudden high fever of 38.8 and it hasn't broken yet, leaving me soaking in sweat one minute and freezing the next.

This started yesterday afternoon with zero warning and now I am bedridden, agonizingly sore everywhere, and just hyper-fixated on every single symptom because I have never felt this sick and exhausted in my entire life."
Influenza,"It's a struggle just to sit up right now. This fever is stubborn, hovering around 39.1, and the body aches are relentless. I'm trying to manage my sugar levels, but I just have zero appetite."
Influenza,"It's a struggle to catch my breath right now. Started feeling awful really suddenly this evening. I'm coughing up a storm and running a fever of 38.4. Since my lungs are already bad, I'm a bit worried, but I'm resting up."
Influenza,"It's hard enough breathing with my lungs acting up, but this flu is something else entirely. I got a sudden high fever of 39.1 and a dry cough that really hurts my ribs. I'm totally floored by this one."
Influenza,"It's hard to catch my breath with my lungs acting up like this. I started feeling poorly very suddenly yesterday. Fever is 38.6, and I'm coughing up a storm. I'm just taking it easy in my armchair."

Influenza,"Just wanna sleep... everything hurts, even my hair feels sore if that makes sense. I'm roasting in bed but I can't get warm enough. Started feeling like trash maybe last night?"
Influenza,"Kids are fed, but I can't do the dishes. Temperature is 38.9. Came on fast while I was driving back from the store. My back aches significantly. It is frustrating to leave the house in this state."

Influenza,"Man, I feel like I got hit by a bus or something... just woke up and everything hurts. I'm sweating bullets but I'm freezing at the same time? My throat is kinda scratchy too and I just wanna lay down."
Influenza,"Managing my blood sugar is a nightmare right now because I can barely eat, and this sudden flu has completely derailed my routine since it started two days ago. My fever is stuck at 39 and I'm terrified of getting dehydrated or developing complications because I'm diabetic. My whole body hurts, deep in the bones, and the fatigue is so overwhelming that I'm scared I won't be able to take care of myself properly."
Influenza,"Monitor became unreadable due to headache. Fever 38.7. Shoulders seized up. Had to leave the meeting. BP is fine, but I can't function in a suit like this. Going to sleep it off."
Influenza,"My asthma already makes me nervous, but this sudden fever of 38.5 has sent me into a total panic! I can barely breathe through my nose and my throat feels like it is on fire. It hit me like a ton of bricks just an hour ago and I'm scared my lungs will fail. I feel so weak and dizzy that I'm afraid to be alone right now. Should I go to the emergency room immediately before my breathing gets worse?"
Influenza,"My asthma has been aggravated by a sudden dry cough and a fever of 39.2 degrees. Breathing is labored during movement, so I am remaining in bed. I need verification of this illness for my university records."

Influenza,"My blood pressure is usually high, but now my heart is racing and I am extremely worried about this sudden fever of 38.5. I feel completely drained of energy, like someone pulled the plug on me within minutes. My cough is dry and painful, and my chest hurts every time I try to breathe deeply. I am scared this is going to cause a heart attack because the body aches are unbearable. Please tell me what to do!"
Influenza,"My blood sugar numbers are all over the place and it is making me panic because I can't keep food down. It started late last night with a violent chill that shook the whole bed and I immediately knew I was in trouble. I checked my temperature and it was 39.5, and now I feel completely drained and my skin actually hurts to touch. I am diabetic so I know this is risky, and the body aches are just relentless and frightening."
Influenza,My body temperature reached 39.8 an hour ago. The joint pain is significant enough that I cannot sit at my desk. I need to confirm if this is contagious before returning to the office.
Influenza,My body temperature spiked to 39.1 approximately two hours ago. The headache is limiting my ability to focus on screens or reading materials. I need a prescription to reduce the fever.

Influenza,"My breathing has become labored, and I have a dry cough that started abruptly. The thermometer reads 38.5. I need to ensure this will not trigger an asthma exacerbation."

Influenza,"My chest is rattling again... worse than usual. I feel all clammy and weak, just started feeling poorly after dinner."
Influenza,"My chest is rattling and I can't seem to clear my throat. I was fine for my morning walk, but now I'm running a 38.6 fever. It's miserable being this congested."
Influenza,"My chest is so tight with this asthma acting up, and I can't stop coughing. I spiked a fever of 38.8 out of nowhere this afternoon. Just want to sleep for a week."
Influenza,My chest is tight and I'm wheezing a bit more than usual... feeling very warm and just... unwell. I was fine yesterday morning but by evening I was done for.
Influenza,"My COPD is bad enough usually, but this sudden illness is making me feel like I am suffocating! I checked my temperature and it is 38.7, which explains why I am burning up and freezing at the same time. The fatigue is overwhelming, like my limbs are made of lead, and I am so scared my lungs are failing. Is this an emergency? I am panicking because I can't get a deep breath in!"
Influenza,"My COPD makes every breath a struggle, but this sudden fever of 38.4 has me fearing for my life! I feel like I am drowning in my own chest and I am so incredibly weak I can't sit up. I was fine at lunch and now I can barely lift my arm to hold the phone to my ear. I am terrified that at my age this will turn into something fatal very quickly. Do I need an ambulance immediately or can I wait this out?"
Influenza,"My daughter said to write this down, I have been very sick for four days with a high fever of 38.5 and terrible body aches that won't quit. I am diabetic and I feel very confused and weak, which is making me panic about my health. The cough is there but the worst part is how tired I am, I feel like I simply cannot move my limbs and I am worried I won't bounce back from this."
Influenza,My eyes hurt so much when I move them and my temperature has shot up to 38.7 so quickly! I am really frightened because I have never felt such intense exhaustion and body pain before. It feels like my bones are breaking and I am scared this isn't just a normal virus. I was perfectly healthy an hour ago and now I am a mess. Do I need to see a specialist immediately?
Influenza,"My eyes literally hurt when I move them, and the light is killing me. I was fine at breakfast but now I feel like I've been beaten up. Super dry cough too."
Influenza,My fever just spiked to 39.2 and I am panicking because I have asthma and my chest feels incredibly tight! It came on so suddenly out of nowhere and now I can't stop coughing and gasping for air. I am terrified that my lungs are shutting down on me. Is a fever this high dangerous for someone with my condition? I feel like I am burning up and freezing at the same time!
Influenza,My glucose levels are fluctuating because I cannot eat due to nausea. I have a fever of 39.1 and severe muscle weakness. Immediate advice on medication management is necessary.
Influenza,"My head feels like a balloon that's about to pop. I tried to work but I got so dizzy I had to sit down. My skin hurts to the touch, is that normal?"
Influenza,"My head feels like it is going to explode and I am extremely worried about my temperature which is currently 40.0. This fever just spiked out of nowhere and I am sweating yet freezing at the same time. I am terrified that my brain is cooking because I feel so delirious and weak. My eyes hurt when I move them and my muscles are twitching uncontrollably. Is this dangerous, because I seriously feel like I am dying?"
Influenza,"My head is pounding like a drum and I am burning up at 39.2. It came on so fast while I was cooking dinner. I am a bit worried about my blood pressure with all this stress on my body, but I am taking it easy."
Influenza,"My head is pounding like a drum, and the chills are uncontrollable. I checked my temp and it's 38.4. I took my blood pressure meds, but I'm just gonna lay low because this thing hit me like a ton of bricks."
Influenza,"My head is pounding so bad, I can't even look at my phone. I think I have a fever? My skin feels like it's on fire. It just started out of nowhere while I was at work."
Influenza,"My head is pounding so hard I can hear my heartbeat in my ears and I am terrified my blood pressure is through the roof along with this 101.8 fever. It started yesterday afternoon and completely knocked me out within an hour. I am aching all over, sweating then freezing, and I am just so worried that the stress of this illness is going to cause a heart issue or something because I feel totally wretched."
Influenza,"My heart is racing and I'm worried it's my blood pressure, but I think it's just this terrible flu that started yesterday afternoon. I'm sweating through my sheets with a temperature of 102, and every muscle in my body is screaming in pain, it is a truly miserable and frightening experience."
Influenza,"My heart is racing so fast that I am afraid I might have a heart attack right here! My temperature just shot up to 39.0 and I feel completely delirious and weak. With my high blood pressure, is it safe to have a fever this high without medical intervention? I feel like I have been hit by a truck, and the pain in my legs is excruciating. I am so worried that my body can't handle this stress!"
Influenza,"My husband is very worried about me because I seemed fine at breakfast and then collapsed into bed with a 103.5 fever by lunch. I feel so fragile and the body aches are excruciating, I am terrified this will strain my heart too much because I just can't stop shivering."

Influenza,"My sugars are all over the place today... I feel like I'm baking in an oven. Coughing a lot too, dry hacking cough that hurts my ribs. Started feeling trashy last night out of nowhere."

Pneumonia,"Yesterday, a high fever of 103.2°F came on suddenly with rigors. I am coughing up a significant amount of green-brown phlegm. There's a sharp pain on my right side that worsens with any breathing motion. My breathing is rapid, and I feel terrible."
Pneumonia,"Yesterday, a mild temperature of 101.2°F began, along with a cough that produces a small amount of clear phlegm. I experience some minimal chest pain on my left side, primarily when I cough hard. While I feel generally weak, I can still perform most activities, though I notice some shortness of breath upon exertion."
Pneumonia,"Yesterday, I suddenly developed a high fever of 103.3°F along with shaking chills. I'm coughing up copious amounts of green sputum. A very sharp pain is present on my right side, which worsens when I breathe. I also feel breathless and my entire body aches."
Pneumonia,"Yesterday, this started all of a sudden with a pronounced fever of 102.8°F. I'm coughing up pink sputum. I have a pleuritic pain in my chest that really intensifies when I cough or breathe in deep. Right now, I have pronounced shortness of breath and significant malaise. The symptoms are severe, this is very uncomfortable, and I'm really, really struggling."
Pneumonia,"For the last three days, I've had a horrible fever of 103Â°F and the worst muscle and joint pain of my life. It feels like my bones are breaking. My head hurts, especially behind my eyes, and I feel sick to my stomach. I have a slight cough, but it's completely dry with no phlegm."
Pneumonia,It started two days ago with a sudden high fever and an unbearable headache right behind my eyes. Every muscle in my body aches so much it's hard to move. I've also noticed some tiny red spots on my arms today. There's no chest pain when I breathe and I haven't been coughing up any colored stuff.
Pneumonia,"I've been feeling awful since yesterday. A high fever that won't break, intense pain in my joints, and a pounding headache. I threw up this morning and have no appetite. My breathing is fine, and I don't have any kind of productive cough, just this overwhelming body pain that makes it hard to rest."
Pneumonia,"The fever has been up and down for four days, currently 102.5Â°F. My whole body feels like it's been hit by a truck, especially my back and legs. The pain behind my eyes is constant. I feel nauseous but haven't vomited. Importantly, I have no shortness of breath and my cough is just a dry tickle."
Pneumonia,"A fever of 103.5Â°F started suddenly about 48 hours ago. The pain in my joints is excruciating, making it painful to even get out of bed. I have a bad headache and feel dizzy. I have no chest pain or difficulty breathing, and I'm not coughing up any mucus at all."
Pneumonia,"Yesterday I was fine, but I woke up this morning feeling like I'd been run over. A fever of 102Â°F, every muscle aches, and I have zero energy. I have a hacking cough, but it's very dry with no phlegm coming up. The worst part is the body aches and the chills. No stabbing chest pains."
Pneumonia,"It hit me like a ton of bricks within a few hours. I went from feeling okay to having a 103Â°F fever, severe muscle pains, and a headache that won't quit. I'm so tired I can barely lift my head. My cough is just a dry, irritating bark and I have no phlegm or trouble breathing."

Pneumonia,"The onset was incredibly fast. In the afternoon I started feeling achy, and by evening I had a 102.8Â°F fever and couldn't get out of bed. The fatigue is overwhelming. I do have a cough, but it's completely non-productive. My chest feels clear and there's no pain with breathing."
Pneumonia,"I'm running a fever of 102.2Â°F and feel weaker than I ever have before. The muscle aches are intense, from my neck down to my legs. I have a sore throat and a dry cough. I've been making sure to drink fluids but feel very drained. My breathing is normal, not rapid or difficult."
Pneumonia,"It started three days ago with a dry cough, a really bad runny nose, and red, watery eyes that hurt in the light. My fever was about 101Â°F. This morning, I noticed a red, blotchy rash starting on my face and behind my ears. I am not coughing up any phlegm."
Pneumonia,"For a few days, I've had what felt like a bad cold: fever, runny nose, and my eyes have been very red and sensitive. My cough is dry and doesn't produce any mucus. Today, a rash appeared on my forehead and is now spreading down my neck. There's no stabbing pain in my chest."
Pneumonia,"I had a fever, a hacking dry cough, and really pink, irritated eyes for about four days. I felt miserable. Now, a spotty red rash has started all over my face and is moving down my chest. My breathing has been fine the whole time, with no shortness of breath."
Pneumonia,"The first symptoms were a runny nose, red eyes, and a dry cough that lasted a couple of days along with a fever. Then this rash broke out on my hairline and cheeks yesterday and is on my torso today. The cough is still there, but it's just dry, no thick phlegm."

Pneumonia,"The problem is entirely in my gut. I've had explosive, watery diarrhea about 7 times since this morning. The cramping is significant. I feel a bit lightheaded, probably from losing so much fluid. I want to be clear that I have no respiratory symptoms, no cough, and no chest pain."
