# Documentations

Just an area where documentations, tutorials, or walkthroughs about the project can be stored. Especially if there are vibe-coded or AI-generated implementations, this is a good place to keep track of them and learn from them.

So I suggest na if may specific **big/heavy** feature or implementation na AI-generated or vibe-coded, at the end ng AI chat or session, ask the AI to generate a documentation or walkthrough about the implementation, then save it here for future reference kasi baka may gusto kang balikan na specific implementation or feature in the future + we can learn den if titiyagin or sisipagin taung basahin HAHAHAHAHA
